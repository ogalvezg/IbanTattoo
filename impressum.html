            Google Fonts Local Privacy Policy<br><br>
            We use Google Fonts from Google Inc. on our website. Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for the European area. We have integrated the Google fonts locally, ie on our web server - not on the Google servers. This means that there is no connection to Google servers and therefore no data transmission or storage.
            <br><br>
            What are Google Fonts?<br><br>
            In the past, Google Fonts was also called Google Web Fonts. This is an interactive directory with over 800 fonts that Google  provides for free. With Google Fonts you could use fonts without uploading them to your own server. But in order to prevent any information transfer to Google servers in this regard, we have downloaded the fonts to our server. In this way, we act in compliance with data protection regulations and do not send any data to Google Fonts.
            
            Unlike other web fonts, Google allows us unrestricted access to all fonts. We can therefore have unlimited access to a sea of ​​fonts and thus get the most out of our website. You can find more about Google Fonts and other questions at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=321245059 .
            <br><br>
            Google Analytics privacy policy<br><br>
            We use the Google Analytics (GA) analysis tracking tool from the American company Google Inc. on our website. Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services in Europe. Google Analytics collects data about your actions on our website. For example, if you click on a link, this action is saved in a cookie and sent to Google Analytics. With the help of the reports we receive from Google Analytics, we can better adapt our website and our service to your needs. In the following, we will go into more detail about the tracking tool and, above all, inform you about which data is stored and how you can prevent this.
            <br><br>
            What is Google Analytics<br><br>
            Google Analytics is a tracking tool that is used to analyze our website's traffic. In order for Google Analytics to work, a tracking code is built into the code of our website. When you visit our website, this code records various actions that you carry out on our website. As soon as you leave our website, this data is sent to the Google Analytics server and stored there.
            <br><br>
            Google processes the data and we receive reports on your user behavior. These reports can include the following:
            <br><br>
            Target group reports: We use target group reports to get to know our users better and to know more precisely who is interested in our service.
            Ad reports: Ad reports make it easier for us to analyze and improve our online advertising.
            Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports give us helpful information on how we can get more people excited about our service.
            Behavioral Reports: This is where we learn how you interact with our website. We can understand which route you take on our site and which links you click.
            Conversion reports: Conversion is a process in which you carry out a desired action based on a marketing message. For example, when you go from being a pure website visitor to being a buyer or newsletter subscriber. With the help of these reports, we can find out more about how you are receiving our marketing measures. This is how we want to increase our conversion rate.
            Real-time reports: Here we always find out immediately what is happening on our website. For example, we can see how many users are reading this text.<br><br>
            Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?<br><br>
            Our goal with this website is clear: We want to offer you the best possible service. The statistics and data from Google Analytics help us to achieve this goal.
            <br><br>
            The statistically evaluated data show us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On the one hand, we can optimize our site so that interested people can find it more easily on Google. On the other hand, the data helps us to better understand you as a visitor. We therefore know very well what we need to improve on our website in order to offer you the best possible service. The data also help us to carry out our advertising and marketing measures more individually and cost-effectively. After all, it only makes sense to show our products and services to people who are interested in them.
            <br><br>
            Which data is saved by Google Analytics?<br><br>
            Google Analytics uses a tracking code to create a random, unique ID that is linked to your browser cookie. This is how Google Analytics recognizes you as a new user. The next time you visit our site, you will be recognized as a "returning" user. All collected data is saved together with this user ID. This is the only way to evaluate pseudonymous user profiles.
            <br><br>
            Tags such as cookies and app instance IDs measure your interactions on our website. Interactions are all types of actions that you carry out on our website. If you also use other Google systems (such as a Google account), data generated by Google Analytics can be linked to third-party cookies. Google does not pass on any Google Analytics data unless we, as the website operator, approve it. Exceptions may be made if required by law.
            <br><br>
            The following cookies are used by Google Analytics:

            <br><br>
            Here we show you an overview of the most important data that is collected with Google Analytics:
            <br><br>
            Heatmaps: Google creates so-called heatmaps. Heatmaps show exactly those areas that you click on. This way we get information about where you are on our site.
            <br><br>
            Session duration: Google defines the session duration as the time that you spend on our site without leaving the site. If you have been inactive for 20 minutes, the session ends automatically.
            <br><br>
            Bounce rate: We speak of a bounce if you only view one page on our website and then exit our website again.
            <br><br>
            Account creation : When you create an account or place an order on our website, Google Analytics collects this data.
            <br><br>
            IP address: The IP address is only shown in abbreviated form so that no clear assignment is possible.
            <br><br>
            Location: The country and your approximate location can be determined via the IP address. This process is also known as IP location determination.
            <br><br>
            Technical information: The technical information includes, among other things, your browser type, your Internet provider or your screen resolution.
            <br><br>
            Source of origin: Google Analytics or us, of course, also interested in which website or which advertising you came to our site.
            <br><br>
            Further data are contact details, any ratings, playing media (e.g. if you play a video on our site), sharing content via social media or adding it to your favorites. The list does not claim to be complete and only serves as a general guide to data storage by Google Analytics.
            <br><br>
            How long and where is the data stored?<br><br>
            Google has distributed your servers all over the world. Most of the servers are located in America and consequently your data is mostly stored on American servers. Here you can read exactly where the Google data centers are located: https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de
            <br><br>
            Your data is distributed on various physical data carriers. This has the advantage that the data can be accessed more quickly and is better protected against manipulation. Every Google data center has appropriate emergency programs for your data. If, for example, the hardware at Google fails or natural disasters paralyze servers, the risk of service interruption at Google remains low.
            <br><br>
            A standard storage period for your user data of 26 months is set in Google Analytics. Then your user data will be deleted. However, we have the option of choosing the retention period for user data ourselves. We have five options for this:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Deletion after 14 months:</li>
                
                <li>Is used to lower the request rate. If Google Analytics is provided via Google Tag Manager, this cookie is named _dc_gtm_ "property-id".</li>
                
                <li>Deletion after 26 months</li>
                
                <li>Deletion after 38 months</li>
                
                <li>No automatic deletion</li>
                
            </ul>
            <br> <br> 
            When the specified period has expired, the data is deleted once a month. This retention period applies to your data linked to cookies, user identification and advertising IDs (e.g. cookies from the DoubleClick domain). Report results are based on aggregated data and are stored independently of user data. Aggregated data is a merging of individual data into a larger unit.
            <br><br>
            How can I delete my data or prevent data storage? <br><br>
            According to the data protection law of the European Union, you have the right to receive information about your data, to update it, to delete it or to restrict it. With the help of the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js), you prevent Google Analytics from using your data. You can download and install the browser add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de . Please note that this add-on only deactivates data collection by Google Analytics.
            <br><br>
            If you generally want to deactivate, delete or manage cookies (independent of Google Analytics), there are separate instructions for each browser:
            <br><br>
            Chrome: Delete, activate and manage cookies in Chrome
            <br><br>
            Safari: manage cookies and website data with Safari
            <br><br>
            Firefox: Delete cookies to remove data that websites have stored on your computer
            <br><br>
            Internet Explorer: deleting and managing cookies
            <br><br>
            Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies
            <br><br>
            Google Analytics is an active participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data. You can find more information on this at https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&tid=321245059 . We hope we were able to provide you with the most important information about data processing by Google Analytics. If you want to find out more about the tracking service, we recommend these two links: http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html and https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245 ? hl = de .
            <br><br>
            Google Analytics IP anonymization<br><br>
            We have implemented the IP address anonymization of Google Analytics on this website. This function was developed by Google so that this website can comply with the applicable data protection regulations and recommendations of the local data protection authorities if they prohibit the storage of the full IP address. The anonymization or masking of the IP takes place as soon as the IP addresses arrive in the Google Analytics data collection network and before the data is stored or processed.
            <br><br>
            You can find more information on IP anonymization at  https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=de .
